# SD Webui Image Comparison
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), which adds a new tab for image comparison.

Wanna check how well your `img2img` upscale went? Upload the input and output images to the new **Comparison** tab to see!

This also comes with a button to automatically load them for you.

There are probably existing packages for this purpose. 
But writing one myself is a good practice, and gives a sense of achievement :p
